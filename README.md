Ever seen those viral meme videos of a massive Rock, Paper, Scissors battle where one group eventually takes over? This is that simulation, brought to life with Python and Pygame!

This project is a fully interactive simulation where you can set the parameters and watch the chaos unfold until a single victor remains.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Settings:** A user-friendly menu to customize the simulation before it starts.
* **Customizable Simulation:** Control the screen size, total number of objects, object size, and movement speed.
* **Physics-Based Movement:** Objects move dynamically and bounce realistically off the walls.
* **RPS Battle Logic:** When objects of different types collide, the loser is converted to the winner's type based on classic Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.
* **Smooth Animations:** Objects rotate as they move, creating a more dynamic visual experience.
* **Automatic Winner Detection:** The simulation automatically stops and declares a winner when only one type of object remains.
